# Heaps

# A heap is a type of tree data structure that is ueseful when we want to constantly keep tabs on the greatest or least data element in a dataset

# Different data structure: Priority Queue

# The queue is a list in which items are processed First In, First Out.

# A priority queue is a list whose deletions and access are just like a classic queue, but whose insertions are like an ordered array.

# One way we can implement a priority queue is by using a simple ordered array. That is, we use an array, and aply the following constraints:
# - When we insert data, we always ensure that we maintain proper order.
# - Data can only be deleted from the end of the array

# The priorty queue has two primary operations: deletions and insertions.


##### HEAPS  ###

# There are several different types of heaps, but we're going to focus on the binary heap.

# The binary heap is a specific kind of binary tree.

# The binary max-heap is a binary tree that maintains the following conditions:

# - The value of each node must be greater than each of its descendant nodes. This condition is known as the heap condition.
# - The tree must be complete
