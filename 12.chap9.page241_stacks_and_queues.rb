# Stacks and Queues

# Stacks and Queues are simply arrays with restrictions. Yet, these restrictions are what makes them so elegant.

# Stacks and queues are elegant tools for handling temporary data.

# Stacks and Queues serve as temporary containers that can be used to form beautifuyl algoritms.

# Temporary data is information that doesn't have any meaning after it's procesed, so you can throw it away once you're done with it.

# Stacks and queues have a special focus on the order in which the data is handled.

# Stacks

# A stack stores data in the same way that arrays do- it's simply a list of elements. The one catch is that stacks have the folowing three constraints:

# 1) Data can be inserted only at the end of a stack.
# 2) Data can be deleted only from the end of the stack
# 3) Only the last element of a stack can be read.

# You an think of a stack as an actual stack of dishes: you can't look at the face of any dish other than the one at the top. Simililarly, you can't add any dish except to the top of the stack, nor can you remove any dish beshides the one at the top.
